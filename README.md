# CorporationX
Project: Startup Platform Development <br>
I had the privilege of contributing to the development of a groundbreaking startup platform with the goal of empowering entrepreneurs and innovators in their startup journey.
Each team has its own master branch in the shared repository. There is a branch for my Cerberus-master command, which contains all the stable code for that command in a specific service.
